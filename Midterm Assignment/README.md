## Introduction

Predictive maintenance is crucial for minimizing downtime and improving reliability in industrial conveyor belt systems. This project focuses on creating a predictive maintenance model that can detect maintenance requirements in real-time by analyzing sensor data.

The project consists of several key tasks, including:

1. **Data Simulation**: Synthetic sensor data is generated to simulate temperature, vibration, and belt speed measurements. This data includes normal operation as well as failure scenarios with adjustable failure probabilities.

2. **Data Processing**: The generated data is preprocessed, scaled, and split into training and testing sets to prepare it for model training.

3. **LSTM Model**: An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is created using TensorFlow and Keras. This model is designed for binary classification to detect maintenance requirements.

4. **Model Training**: The LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed data. Training includes specifying the number of epochs and batch size.

5. **Real-Time Simulation**: A real-time data simulation is implemented to generate sensor data and make predictions using the trained model. Alerts are triggered when predictions exceed an alert threshold.

6. **Completing the Assignment**: The simulation is run for a specified number of iterations, and results are documented, including predictions and alerting events. A summary report explains the project, data generation, model training, and results.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data_simulation.py`: Contains functions for data simulation and preprocessing.
- `lstm_model.py`: Defines the LSTM model architecture and includes model training functions.
- `real_time_simulation.py`: Implements real-time data simulation and alerting logic.
- `summary_report.txt`: A summary report explaining the project, tasks, and results.
- `simulation_results.txt`: Contains simulation results and alert events.
- `README.md`: The README file for project documentation.

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks that are implemented as Python scripts:

- **Task 1**: Data Simulation
- **Task 2**: Data Processing
- **Task 3**: LSTM Model
- **Task 4**: Model Training
- **Task 5**: Real-Time Simulation
- **Task 6**: Completing the Assignment

## Usage

   - `real_time_simulation.py`

2. Modify the parameters, such as the number of iterations and alert thresholds, to match your specific use case.

3. Review the simulation results and alert events recorded in `simulation_results.txt`.

4. Read the summary report in `summary_report.txt` to understand the project in detail.

## Results

The project demonstrates the feasibility of using predictive maintenance to reduce downtime and improve conveyor belt reliability. Simulation results and alerting events provide valuable insights into the model's performance.

## Conclusion

Predictive maintenance for conveyor belts is a crucial application of machine learning and deep learning techniques. This project serves as a foundation for implementing real-time maintenance strategies, potentially saving resources and increasing system reliability.
