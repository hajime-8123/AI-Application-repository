# Supermarket Sales Forecasting Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Supermarket Sales Forecasting project! This collaborative effort aims to predict product ratings in various supermarket branches using advanced machine learning models. The project is the result of the combined efforts of a four-member team, with each member contributing expertise to specific product lines.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to forecast product ratings in different supermarket branches. Through data preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation, our team aims to provide valuable insights into the sales dynamics of diverse product lines.

### Team Member
- Ehonkulov Atkham - Responsible for Data Preprocessing and Exploration, Model Implementation and Model Comparison and Reporting.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into distinct parts, each contributing to the overall success of the forecasting endeavor.

### Data Preprocessing and Exploration
In this phase, the team focused on preparing and understanding the dataset. Key tasks included loading the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

### Model Implementation
The implementation phase involved designing and training machine learning models. Notable contributions include leading the implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, contributing to the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, and introducing the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for time series forecasting.

### Model Comparison and Reporting
The final stages of the project centered on comparing the performance of diverse machine learning models. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) were calculated to assess each model's predictive accuracy. The team aimed to provide clear insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model for informed decision-making.
